üíº Business Aim

Geldium's core mission is to enhance the health of its loan portfolio while optimizing the collections process.

The current system is largely reactive and inefficient, leading to:

Increased operational costs

Potential customer churn

This project addresses these challenges by implementing a proactive, data-driven solution designed to:

Prevent accounts from becoming delinquent

Streamline collections for at-risk customers

Reduce financial losses

Enhance the overall customer experience

üìù Project Summary

This initiative transforms Geldium from a reactive to a predictive collections strategy through a responsible, AI-powered system. The work was executed in three key phases:

Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective: Understand customer data and identify key risk factors for delinquency.

Key Findings:

High missed payments

High credit utilization

Low credit scores

These were identified as the strongest predictors of delinquency.

Phase 2: Predictive Model Planning

Objective: Design a predictive model to identify at-risk customers.

Solution:

Model Chosen: Logistic Regression

Reason: Balances accuracy with interpretability, critical for transparent financial decisions

Ethical Considerations:

Implemented a robust evaluation strategy to detect and mitigate bias across customer groups

Phase 3: Automated System Design

Objective: Convert predictive insights into a scalable, automated system.

System Design:

Human-in-the-loop approach: AI manages routine tasks (e.g., payment reminders), while human agents handle complex negotiations

Expected Business Impact:

Reduced delinquency rates

Lower operational costs

Improved customer satisfaction through proactive, personalized support
