Tata Gen AI â€“ AI-Powered Data Analytics (Project Simulation)
ðŸ’¼ Business Aim
Geldium's core mission is to enhance the health of its loan portfolio while optimizing the collections process. The current system is reactive and inefficient, leading to increased operational costs and potential customer churn. This project addresses these challenges by implementing a proactive, data-driven solution designed to prevent accounts from becoming delinquent, streamline collections for at-risk customers, reduce financial losses, and enhance the overall customer experience.

Project Summary
This initiative transforms Geldium from a reactive to a predictive collections strategy through a responsible, AI-powered system. The work was executed in three key phases, culminating in a presentation for executive stakeholders.

Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Understand customer data and identify key risk factors for delinquency.

Key Findings: The analysis revealed that high missed payments, high credit utilization, and low credit scores are the strongest predictors of delinquency.

Phase 2: Predictive Model Planning
Objective: Design a predictive model to identify at-risk customers.

Solution: A Logistic Regression model was chosen for its balance of accuracy and interpretability, which is critical for transparent financial decisions.

Ethical Considerations: A robust evaluation strategy was implemented to detect and mitigate bias across customer groups.

Phase 3: Automated System Design & Executive Briefing
Objective: Convert predictive insights into a scalable, automated system and present the strategic vision to stakeholders.

System Design: The proposed system uses a human-in-the-loop approach, where AI manages routine tasks (e.g., payment reminders), while human agents handle complex negotiations.

Deliverable: A PowerPoint presentation was created to outline the system's workflow, ethical guardrails, and expected business impact for a non-technical audience.

Expected Business Impact: The system is projected to reduce delinquency rates, lower operational costs, and improve customer satisfaction through proactive, personalized support.
