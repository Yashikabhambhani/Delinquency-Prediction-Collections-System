Business Aim
Geldium's core business aim is to improve the health of its loan portfolio and optimize the collections process. The current system is reactive and inefficient, leading to increased costs and potential customer churn. This project tackles that challenge by building a proactive, data-driven solution. The goal is to prevent customer accounts from becoming delinquent and streamline the collections process for those that do, ultimately reducing financial losses and enhancing the customer experience.

Project Summary
This project moves Geldium from a reactive to a predictive strategy by implementing a responsible, AI-powered system for collections. The work was completed in three key phases:

Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: To understand customer data and identify key risk factors for delinquency.

Key Findings: The analysis revealed that high missed payments, high credit utilization, and low credit scores are the strongest predictors of delinquency.

Phase 2: Predictive Model Planning
Objective: To design a predictive model that identifies at-risk customers.

Solution: A Logistic Regression model was chosen for its balance of accuracy and interpretability, which is essential for transparent financial decisions.

Ethical Focus: The plan includes a robust evaluation strategy to test for and mitigate potential bias against different customer groups.

Phase 3: Automated System Design
Objective: To transform predictive insights into a scalable, automated system.

System Design: The proposed system uses a human-in-the-loop model, where AI handles routine tasks (e.g., sending payment reminders), freeing up human agents for more complex negotiations.

Business Impact: The system is expected to reduce delinquency rates, lower operational costs, and improve customer satisfaction through proactive, personalized support.
